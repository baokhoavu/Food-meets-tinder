#Project 3 (Group Friends4Eva): Dinder - Food Meets Tinder! 

##Getting Started

###Installation
A facebook account is required to use Dinder. On the home page, click
to login, and you will be redirected to facebook to confirm login 
credentials.

###Instructions
Once logged in, you will arrive at the users page, where you can perform
Dinder searches or view past Dinder likes. To start a new Dinder search,
click on the link and input as many specified fields to search for (by 
default it will search for restaurants from your current location). Then 
choose to like or dislike the search results to narrow down what
restaurants will be displayed to you on your liked page. After performing
multiple searches, you can view your likes in the liked page where you
edit the returned yelp businesses (👍 or 👎 )

###MVP
-Oauth login (facebook)
-Creates JSON (based off of a user's yelp api call) 
-Mongoose to CRUD user data
-Data rendered as interacatable cards
-Deployed online using Heroku
